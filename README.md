**What is String in Java**
Strings are sequences of characters in Java. You can create a string either using String Literals or with the new keyword. Java provides many methods for working with strings, such as equals(), replace(), substring(), toUpperCase(), and split().
 
 
 **Difference between str1 == str2 and str1.equals(str2)?**
== checks if both references point to the same memory location (reference comparison).
equals() compares the actual content (value comparison).
Example:
String str1 = new String("Scaler");
String str2 = new String("Scaler");
System.out.println(str1 == str2);  // false
System.out.println(str1.equals(str2));  // true


**Is String a Primitive or Derived Type in Java?**
Strings are derived data types in Java. They are objects created using the java.lang.String class and support many useful methods for string manipulation.


**Difference between String in C and String in Java:**
In C: Strings are arrays of characters terminated by a null character (\0).
In Java: Strings are objects of the java.lang.String class and are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed once created.


**String Pool in Java:**
The String Pool (or String Constant Pool) is a special area in Java's memory that stores unique string objects. When a string is created, Java checks if the same value already exists in the pool. If it does, the reference to the existing object is returned.


**Is String Immutable or Final in Java?**
Strings are immutable in Java, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed. This ensures benefits like security, caching, and synchronization.


**What does the intern() Method Do in Java?**
The intern() method ensures that strings with the same content share the same memory reference by checking if the string is already in the String Pool.

Example:
String str1 = new String("Scaler").intern();
String str2 = new String("Scaler").intern();
System.out.println(str1 == str2);  // true


**Difference between String and StringBuffer:**
String: Immutable, meaning any change results in a new object being created.
StringBuffer: Mutable, allowing in-place modifications without creating new objects.


**Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder:**
StringBuffer: Thread-safe but slower due to synchronization.
StringBuilder: Not thread-safe but faster than StringBuffer, making it more efficient for single-threaded applications.


**How to Compare Strings in Java?**
equals(): Compares the actual content.
equalsIgnoreCase(): Compares content ignoring case.
compareTo(): Compares strings lexicographically (returns negative, zero, or positive value).
Example:
String str1 = "Scaler";
String str2 = "Scaler";
System.out.println(str1.equals(str2));  // true
System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str2));  // 0


**How to Declare a String in Java?**
Using String Literal:
String str = "Scaler";
**Using new Keyword**
String str = new String("Scaler");


**Is It Possible to Compare Strings Using the == Operator? What Is the Risk?**
Yes, you can compare strings using the == operator, but this compares references (memory addresses), not values. This can lead to errors if the strings have the same content but different memory locations.


**What is the Use of the substring() Method in Java?**
The substring() method returns a part of a string. It takes two parameters: beginIndex (inclusive) and endIndex (exclusive).

Example:
String str = "Scaler by InterviewBit";
System.out.println(str.substring(7));  // "by InterviewBit"
System.out.println(str.substring(0, 6));  // "Scaler"


**Can We Use a String in a Switch Case in Java?**
Yes, Java allows you to use strings in switch case conditions.

Example:
String fruit = "Apple";
switch (fruit) {
    case "Mango": System.out.println("Sweet"); break;
    case "Apple": System.out.println("Delicious"); break;
    case "Orange": System.out.println("Luscious"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Not a fruit"); break;
}
Output: Delicious



**Java String Concepts**
**Object Creation in String**
A. Code Example:

String str1 = "abc"; // Line 1
String str2 = new String("abc"); // Line 2
Explanation:

Two objects are created:
Line 1: A string object "abc" is created and stored in the String Constant Pool.
Line 2: A new string object is created using the new keyword, stored in Heap memory.
Since "abc" already exists in the String Constant Pool, no new string object is created for it.
B. Code Example:

String str1 = "abc"; // Line 1
String str2 = "abc"; // Line 2
Explanation:

One object is created:
Line 1: A string object "abc" is created in the String Constant Pool.
Line 2: The reference str2 points to the same object in the String Constant Pool.
C. Code Example:

String str1 = new String("abc"); // Line 1
String str2 = new String("abc"); // Line 2
Explanation:

Three objects are created:
Line 1: Two objects are created: one in the String Constant Pool and one in Heap memory.
Line 2: A new string object is created in Heap memory (but not in the String Constant Pool, as it already contains "abc").
**Why Use char[] Over String for Storing Passwords?**
Strings are Immutable: Once a String object is created, it cannot be changed. Modifying a password stored in a string results in the creation of a new string object, and sensitive data may remain in memory for a long time, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access.
Security Concerns: Passwords stored in String may remain in the String Constant Pool or memory dumps, making them easier to retrieve.
Logfile Safety: Unlike char[], String data is more likely to be accidentally logged or exposed in debugging information. char[] allows for manual overwriting and cleaning of the data.
**Common String Methods in Java**
Here are some common methods for string manipulation in Java:

split(String regex): Divides the string into substrings based on a specified regular expression.
compareTo(String anotherString): Compares two strings lexicographically.
compareToIgnoreCase(String anotherString): Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences.
length(): Returns the length of the string.
substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex): Returns a new string that is a substring of the original string.
equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString): Compares two strings, ignoring case differences.
contains(CharSequence sequence): Checks if the string contains a specified sequence of characters.
trim(): Removes leading and trailing spaces from the string.
charAt(int index): Returns the character at the specified index.
toLowerCase(): Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
toUpperCase(): Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
concat(String str): Concatenates the specified string to the end of the current string.
**Is String Thread-Safe in Java?**
Yes, String is thread-safe because it is immutable. Once a String object is created, it cannot be modified. If multiple threads access the same string, they will not alter its content, ensuring thread safety. If a thread modifies a string, a new object is created instead of modifying the original one.

**Why is String Used as a Key in HashMap?**
Using strings as keys in a HashMap is efficient because:

Strings are immutable: Their hash codes are constant, making lookups reliable and fast.
If the key is modified after being inserted into the map, the hash code will change, making it impossible to retrieve the value correctly. Since strings cannot be changed after creation, they make ideal keys for HashMap objects.
**Best Way to Split a String in Java**
You can use the split() method to divide a string into substrings based on a regular expression (regex).

Syntax:
string.split(String regex, int limit)
regex: The delimiter (regular expression) that determines where the string will be split.
limit: An optional parameter that controls the maximum number of resulting substrings.
Example:

public class SplitString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Scaler by InterviewBit";
        String[] result = str.split(" ");
        for (String s : result) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
}
Output:
Scaler
by
InterviewBit
**Output of the Program:**

String str1 = "scaler"; // Line 1
String str2 = new String("scaler"); // Line 2
str2.intern(); // Line 3
System.out.println(str1 == str2); // Output
Explanation:

The output is false because the intern() method only affects the String Constant Pool, but since the result of intern() is not assigned back to str2, the reference str2 still points to the object in Heap memory.
If you modify Line 3 to str2 = str2.intern();, the output will be true because str2 will then reference the string in the String Constant Pool, which is the same reference as str1.
**Output of the Program:**

public class StringTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = new String("interviewbit");
        String str2 = new String("INTERVIEWBIT");
        System.out.println(str1 == str2);
    }
}
Explanation:

This program prints false because str1 and str2 are two different objects with different string values. The == operator compares object references, not the contents of the strings.
If you want to compare the content of the strings, use str1.equals(str2) instead of ==.
Output:
false
**How to Convert an Array to String in Java?**
An array can be converted to a string in multiple ways, including using Arrays.toString(), String.join(), StringBuilder.append(), and Collectors.joining().

Example Using Arrays.toString():

import java.util.Arrays;
public class ArrayToString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] strArray = { "Scaler", "by", "InterviewBit" };
        String str1 = ConvertArraytoString(strArray);
        System.out.println("An array converted to a string: " + str1);
    }

    // Using the Arrays.toString() method
    public static String ConvertArraytoString(String[] strArray) {
        return Arrays.toString(strArray);
    }
}
Output:
An array converted to a string: [Scaler, by, InterviewBit]
